## A little bit about myself:

- Name: Josias Alvarado
- Nicaraguan
- Systems Engineering student
- Programmer wannabe
- Occasional chess player and guitarist
- An always curious dude willing to learn all sorts of things...

### Projects

I'm currently working on a simple Flask website for a small startup. Please bear with me on updates
for this website.

#### Projects I intend to work on

This is tough since I have many plans for the future.
Since I'm very interested in OS Development and design, I plan to follow *[Andrew S. Tanenbaum's]*(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum) book 
and exercises based on **[Minix]**(https://www.minix3.org/). I'll upload those as I work on them.

Also, I'd like to work on a small web app that will use Dash and Plotly, but that's just 
an impractical idea I have. :)
